# Daily Temperatures

You are given an array of integers `temperatures` where `temperatures[i]` represents the daily temperatures on the `ith` day.

Return an array where `output[i]` is the number of days after the `ith` day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day. If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the `ith day`, set `output[i]` to `0` instead.

# Examples
```
daily_temperatures([30,38,30,36,35,40,28])
output = [1,4,1,2,1,0,0]

daily_temperatures([22,21,20])
output = [0,0,0]

daily_temperatures([30,38,30,36,35,40,28])
output = [1,4,1,2,1,0,0]
```
