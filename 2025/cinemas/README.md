# Cinemas

Given an array of seats, return the maximum number of new people which can be seated, as long as there is at least a gap of 2 seats between people.

- Empty seats are given as 0.
- Occupied seats are given as 1.
- Don't move any seats which are already occupied, even if they are less than 2 seats apart. Consider only the gaps between new seats and existing seats.
