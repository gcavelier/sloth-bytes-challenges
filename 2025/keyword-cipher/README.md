# Keyword Cipher

A Keyword Cipher replaces each letter of a message with a letter from a shifted alphabet built using a keyword.

1. Start with the keyword.
2. Add the remaining letters of the alphabet (Aâ€“Z) in order, skipping any that already appeared in the keyword.
    - Example keyword: "KEYWORD"
    - Cipher alphabet: KEYWORDABCFGHIJLMNPQSTUVXZ

3. Encrypt by replacing each letter in the message with the letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet.
    - Plain alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    - Cipher alphabet: KEYWORDABCFGHIJLMNPQSTUVXZ
