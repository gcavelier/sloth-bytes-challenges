# No Yelling

Create a function that transforms sentences ending with multiple question marks ? or exclamation marks ! into a sentence only ending with one without changing punctuation in the middle of the sentences.

# Notes

- Only change ending punctuation - keep the exclamation marks or question marks in the middle of the sentence the same (see third example).
- Don't worry about mixed punctuation (no cases that end in something like ?!??!).
- Keep sentences that do not have question/exclamation marks the same.
