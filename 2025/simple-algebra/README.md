# Evaluating Simple Algebra

Given a string containing an algebraic equation, calculate and return the value of x.

You'll only be given equations for simple addition and subtraction.

# Examples

```
evalAlgebra("2 + x = 19")
output = 17

evalAlgebra("4 - x = 1")
output = 3

evalAlgebra("x + 10 = 53")
output = 43

evalAlgebra("-23 + x = -20")
output = 3

evalAlgebra("10 + x = 5")
output = -5

evalAlgebra("-49 - x = -180")
output = 131

evalAlgebra("x - 22 = -56")
output = -34
```

# Notes

- There are spaces between every number and symbol in the string.
- x may be a negative number.
