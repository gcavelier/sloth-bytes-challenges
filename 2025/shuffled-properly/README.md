# Shuffled Properly?

Given an array of 10 numbers, return whether or not the array is shuffled enough.

In this case, if 3 or more numbers appear consecutively (ascending or descending), return false.

# Notes
Only steps of 1 in either direction count as consecutive (i.e. a sequence of odd and even numbers would count as being properly shuffled (see example #4)).

You will get numbers from 1-10.
